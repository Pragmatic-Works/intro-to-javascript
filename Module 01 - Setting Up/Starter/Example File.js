//#region Comments
    //Single line comments can be written with a double forward slash (//)

    /*
    Multiline comments are used to save space, or to comment out a large block of code.
    They're great for saving space, since they can be folded, and 
    everything within the tags (/ *) will be interpreted as a comment, even if 
    you hit 'Enter'
    
    * For this course, I'll be using the Better Comments extension to help highlight particular areas.
    * This marker will be used for headers, and any console inputs.

    ! Comments are of high importance, and will often be used to denote where things can be written and what should not be modified.

    (?) Comments can provide helpful context for sections.

    Result: comments will be used almost exclusively in the completed code files to show a possible way of completing the code.
    + They will also typically be listed at the end of a function or an object.

Note: Comments will be used when other options are possible, or to make a note of a particular line
- these will often be pushed entirely to the left.

    ToDo: comments will be used for the starter files, so that we can see what we need to do.

    // comments are used to cross out items on the todo list, and look like (////).

    //(?)This feature also works for colored comments, but will not change the color to grey if other tags are used with it.

    #region Comments are used to make regions less obtrusive.

    > These are used to note a step in a particular process, or, as you'll see below, mark a detail.
